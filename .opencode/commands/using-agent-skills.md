# Using Agent Skills

Meta-skill for discovering and invoking the right skill for any given task. Use this when starting a session or when you need to determine which specialized skill applies.

## Skill Discovery Tree

```

## Core Operating Behaviors

These apply at all times, across all skills:

1. **Surface assumptions** — State them explicitly before implementing
2. **Manage confusion actively** — Stop, name the confusion, present options, wait for resolution
3. **Push back when warranted** — Point out issues directly, explain the downside, propose alternatives
4. **Enforce simplicity** — Actively resist overcomplication
5. **Maintain scope discipline** — Touch only what you're asked to touch
6. **Verify, don't assume** — Every task includes a verification step

## Lifecycle Sequence

For a complete feature:
```
1. idea-refine                 → Refine vague ideas
2. spec-driven-development     → Define what we're building
3. planning-and-task-breakdown → Break into verifiable chunks
4. context-engineering         → Load the right context
5. source-driven-development   → Verify against official docs
6. incremental-implementation  → Build slice by slice
7. test-driven-development     → Prove each slice works
8. code-review-and-quality     → Review before merge
9. git-workflow-and-versioning → Clean commit history
10. documentation-and-adrs     → Document decisions
11. shipping-and-launch        → Deploy safely
```

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Skill | One-Line Summary |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Define | idea-refine | Refine ideas through structured divergent and convergent thinking |
| Define | spec-driven-development | Requirements and acceptance criteria before code |
| Plan | planning-and-task-breakdown | Decompose into small, verifiable tasks |
| Build | incremental-implementation | Thin vertical slices, test each before expanding |
| Build | source-driven-development | Verify against official docs before implementing |
| Build | context-engineering | Right context at the right time |
| Build | frontend-ui-engineering | Production-quality UI with accessibility |
| Build | api-and-interface-design | Stable interfaces with clear contracts |
| Verify | test-driven-development | Failing test first, then make it pass |
| Verify | browser-testing-with-devtools | Chrome DevTools MCP for runtime verification |
| Verify | debugging-and-error-recovery | Reproduce → localize → fix → guard |
| Review | code-review-and-quality | Five-axis review with quality gates |
| Review | security-and-hardening | OWASP prevention, input validation, least privilege |
| Review | performance-optimization | Measure first, optimize only what matters |
| Ship | git-workflow-and-versioning | Atomic commits, clean history |
| Ship | ci-cd-and-automation | Automated quality gates on every change |
| Ship | documentation-and-adrs | Document the why, not just the what |
| Ship | shipping-and-launch | Pre-launch checklist, monitoring, rollback plan |

## Trigger

"Which skill applies to: [task description]?"
"Help me figure out the right approach for: [description]"
"Start a session for: [feature/idea]"

## Output

The correct skill invoked for the task, or a sequence of skills if the task spans multiple phases.
